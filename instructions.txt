The map shows like this:
  X   hits
  O   misses
  #   ships (not yet hit)

To enter a location:
  Enter the row letter and column number with no spaces

  Example: If you enter the words "B3", then the map will choose the B row and choose the third column from it.

Play fairly:
  Each turn has a loading screen to press enter, which is when players must swap and keep their boards secret. Tell your friend to not look at the board until you are shown your friend's board.
