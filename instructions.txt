This text-based game mirrors the rules of the classic board game.
Just a few notes before you begin:

THE MAP SYMBOLS:
  X   hits
  O   misses
  #   ships (not yet hit)

ENTERING LOCATIONS:
  Enter locations using the row letter and column number,
  with no spaces: e.g. "F10"

TAKING TURNS:
  Each turn begins with an anchor screen to give a chance for
  players to swap places (and keep their boards secret).

MOBILE DEVICES:
  If you're playing on a mobile device, hold it horizontally.
